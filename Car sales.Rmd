# Import the dataset
# The dataset contains car sales data with columns "Date" and "Sales"
sales_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/Alfaz Khan/Downloads/sales.csv")
colnames(sales_data) <- c("Date", "Sales")

# Convert Sales column to numeric for analysis
sales_data$Sales <- as.numeric(sales_data$Sales)

# Remove missing or invalid values
# This ensures data integrity for the analysis
sales_data <- na.omit(sales_data)

# Convert to Time Series
# Convert the cleaned data into a time series object for analysis
ts_sales <- ts(sales_data$Sales, start = c(2019, 1), end = c(2024, 11), frequency = 12)

# Plot the time series
plot(ts_sales, main = "Monthly Car Sales", ylab = "Sales", xlab = "Time")
# Observations:
# The graph shows monthly car sales data. A noticeable trend is observed, 
# with fluctuations indicating seasonality and variability over time.

# STL Decomposition
# Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components
sales_decomposition <- stl(ts_sales, s.window = "periodic")
plot(sales_decomposition, main = "STL Decomposition")
# Observations:
# Trend: Highlights a long-term pattern, peaking in mid-2022 and declining afterward.
# Seasonal: Displays recurring monthly patterns.
# Remainder: Shows random fluctuations or irregularities not explained by trend or seasonality.

# Naive Forecast Method
naive_forecast <- naive(ts_sales, h = 12)
plot(naive_forecast, main = "Naive Forecast")

# Explanation of Naive Forecast Output
# • The Naive method assumes future values will be the same as the last observed value.
# • This results in a flat-line forecast with no consideration of trends or seasonality.
# • It serves as a simple benchmark for comparison against more sophisticated methods.

# Calculate accuracy metrics for Naive forecast
naive_accuracy <- accuracy(naive_forecast)
print(naive_accuracy)
# Explanation:
# • RMSE, MAE, and MAPE are computed to assess the forecast performance.
# • These metrics provide insights into the error levels and overall accuracy of the Naive method.

# Perform Residual Analysis
checkresiduals(naive_forecast)

# Residual Plot
plot(naive_forecast$residuals, main = "Residuals of Naive Forecast", ylab = "Residuals", xlab = "Time")
# Explanation:
# • The residual plot shows deviations between the observed and forecasted values over time.
# • Ideally, residuals should be randomly scattered around zero, indicating no systematic bias in the model.
# • In this case, patterns in the residuals suggest the Naive method fails to capture certain trends in the data.

# Histogram of Residuals
hist(naive_forecast$residuals, main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals")
# Explanation:
# • The histogram shows the distribution of residuals, helping identify any skewness or bias.
# • A roughly symmetric histogram centered at zero indicates balanced forecast errors.
# • If the residuals are not symmetric, the model may be systematically over- or under-forecasting.

# Plot of Fitted Values vs. Residuals
plot(fitted(naive_forecast), naive_forecast$residuals, 
     main = "Fitted Values vs. Residuals", xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals")
# Explanation:
# • This plot checks for correlation between fitted values and residuals.
# • A random scatter around zero indicates no systematic error. Patterns here may indicate the model's limitations in capturing the data.

# Plot of Actual Values vs. Residuals
plot(ts_sales, naive_forecast$residuals, 
     main = "Actual Values vs. Residuals", xlab = "Actual Sales", ylab = "Residuals")
# Explanation:
# • This plot examines whether residuals vary systematically with actual sales values.
# • Ideally, the residuals should be randomly distributed around zero with no relationship to the actual sales values.
# • Any noticeable patterns suggest the model fails to explain all variations in the data.

# Summary
# • The Naive method is a simple approach and works as a baseline for comparison.
# • Residual analysis shows that the method is limited in capturing trends and seasonality, as evident from patterns in residuals.
# • While it is suitable for short-term forecasts, it may not perform well for datasets with strong trends or seasonal components.


# Mean Forecast
# Forecast using the Mean method, which assumes all future values are equal to the mean of past values
mean_forecast <- meanf(ts_sales, h = 12)
plot(mean_forecast, main = "Mean Forecast")
# Observations:
# The Mean forecast produces a horizontal line representing the average of past values.
# It is simplistic and ignores trends or seasonality, making it less reliable for complex data.

# Accuracy metrics for Mean forecast
mean_accuracy <- accuracy(mean_forecast)

# Simple Exponential Smoothing
# Apply Simple Exponential Smoothing to forecast future values
ses_model <- ses(ts_sales, h = 12)
plot(ses_model, main = "SES Forecast")
# Observations:
# • The SES model adjusts predictions based on recent observations but does not consider trend or seasonality.
# • The confidence intervals widen over time, reflecting increasing uncertainty.

# Calculate accuracy metrics for SES
ses_accuracy <- accuracy(ses_model)
# Print SES accuracy
print(ses_accuracy)
# Explanation:
# • RMSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy.
# • Lower values indicate better model performance.

# Perform Residual Analysis for SES

# Residual Plot
plot(ses_model$residuals, main = "Residuals of SES Forecast", ylab = "Residuals", xlab = "Time")
# Explanation:
# • This plot shows residuals over time, i.e., the differences between observed and forecasted values.
# • Ideally, residuals should be randomly scattered around zero, indicating no systematic bias in the model.
# • Patterns in residuals suggest the SES model may not fully capture all patterns in the data.

# Histogram of Residuals
hist(ses_model$residuals, main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals")
# Explanation:
# • The histogram shows the frequency distribution of residuals.
# • A symmetric histogram centered at zero indicates balanced forecast errors with minimal bias.
# • Skewness or non-symmetry suggests systematic over- or under-forecasting.

# Plot of Fitted Values vs. Residuals
plot(fitted(ses_model), ses_model$residuals, 
     main = "Fitted Values vs. Residuals", xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals")
# Explanation:
# • This plot checks for correlation between fitted values and residuals.
# • Ideally, residuals should be randomly scattered around zero, with no visible patterns.
# • Patterns in this plot indicate that SES may fail to capture certain trends in the data.

# Plot of Actual Values vs. Residuals
plot(ts_sales, ses_model$residuals, 
     main = "Actual Values vs. Residuals", xlab = "Actual Sales", ylab = "Residuals")
# Explanation:
# • This plot examines whether residuals vary systematically with actual sales values.
# • Ideally, residuals should be randomly distributed around zero with no relationship to actual sales values.
# • Patterns in this plot suggest SES might not explain all variability in the data.

# Residual Diagnostics for SES
checkresiduals(ses_model)
# Explanation:
# • This function provides a summary of residual analysis, including ACF of residuals and Ljung-Box test.
# • Significant autocorrelation in residuals or a high p-value in the test indicates the model may need improvement.

# Summary of Residual Analysis for SES
# • The residual plots and diagnostics help assess the SES model's fit to the data.
# • Random residuals with no significant patterns indicate a good fit.
# • However, any visible patterns in the residual plots suggest the model might miss trends or seasonality in the dataset.


# Holt-Winters Forecast
# Apply Holt-Winters additive method to account for level, trend, and seasonality in forecasting
hw_model <- HoltWinters(ts_sales, seasonal = "additive")
hw_forecast <- forecast(hw_model, h = 12)
plot(hw_forecast, main = "Holt-Winters Forecast")
# Observations:
# The Holt-Winters method accounts for seasonality and trend, making it more reliable for periodic data.
# Confidence intervals reflect growing uncertainty over the forecast horizon.

# Residual analysis for Holt-Winters
checkresiduals(hw_model)
# Observations:
# Residuals appear random with minimal patterns, indicating a reasonably good model fit.

# If the p-value < 0.05, the series is stationary. Otherwise, differencing is needed.

# Differencing
# Determine the number of differences needed to make the series stationary

# Apply differencing if needed
if (!is.na(d) && d > 0) {
  diff_sales <- diff(ts_sales, differences = d)

  # Observations:
  # The differenced series removes trend components, making the data more stationary.
} else {

}

# ACF and PACF
# Plot the ACF and PACF of the differenced series to identify patterns
Acf(diff_sales, main = "ACF of Differenced Series")
# Observations:
# ACF shows significant spikes at initial lags, indicating autocorrelation in the data.

Pacf(diff_sales, main = "PACF of Differenced Series")
# Observations:
# PACF helps identify the order of the AR component for ARIMA modeling.

# Fit ARIMA Model
# Automatically fit an ARIMA model to the time series
auto_arima_model <- auto.arima(ts_sales, seasonal = FALSE, stepwise = FALSE, trace = TRUE)

# Generate a 1-year forecast using the ARIMA model
forecast_1yr <- forecast(auto_arima_model, h = 12)
plot(forecast_1yr, main = "ARIMA Forecast (1 Year)")
# Observations:
# ARIMA forecast accounts for trend and residual patterns, offering a refined prediction.
# Confidence intervals reflect uncertainty over the forecast horizon.

# Generate a 2-year forecast using the ARIMA model
forecast_2yr <- forecast(auto_arima_model, h = 24)

# Conclusion of Time Series Analysis
# • The time series analysis shows variability in car sales over time, with noticeable seasonality and an overall downward trend in recent periods.
# • The STL decomposition highlighted a peak in sales in 2022, followed by a consistent decline.
#   The seasonal component indicates recurring monthly patterns, while the trend shows a steady decrease.

# Forecast Summary
# • Based on the forecasts:
#   - For the next year: The value of the time series is expected to either decrease slightly or stay flat, as most methods show stabilization or minor downward movement.
#   - For the next 2 years: The downward trend is expected to continue, with increasing uncertainty as reflected in the widening confidence intervals of the forecasts.

# Ranking of Forecasting Methods (including RMSE values for comparison)
# 1. ARIMA: RMSE = 0.7546. The ARIMA model performed best for this dataset as it accounted for trends and residual patterns effectively. 
#    Residual diagnostics indicated a good fit with minimal autocorrelation, and it provided the lowest error among all models.
# 2. SES (Simple Exponential Smoothing): RMSE = 0.7992. This method performed well in capturing the level of the series but could not account for the trend or seasonality. 
#    Its accuracy metrics are comparable to ARIMA.
# 3. Naive Forecast: RMSE = 0.8064. The Naive method served as a baseline and worked as a simple benchmark. While simple, it showed moderate accuracy for short-term forecasts.
# 4. Holt-Winters: RMSE = 0.9622. This method captured both the trend and seasonality, making it suitable for this periodic dataset. However, its RMSE was slightly higher than SES and ARIMA.
# 5. Mean Forecast: RMSE = 1.8528. The Mean method provided the least accurate forecasts due to its simplicity, producing a flat-line prediction that ignored data variability.

# Overall Observation
# • The ARIMA model stands out as the most effective forecasting method for this dataset due to its ability to handle the data's complexity, including trends and residual patterns.
# • The time series is likely to show declining sales over the next two years, emphasizing the need for strategic interventions to reverse this trend.
